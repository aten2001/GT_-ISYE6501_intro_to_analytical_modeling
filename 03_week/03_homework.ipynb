I expected the end dates to actually be later after exponential smoothing because the threshold would be harder to surpass if the data was more stable. However, the opposite was true. My hypothesis as to why this happened is that the volatility in the temperature data causes the S_t value to fluctuate a lot. So, the S_t value can come close to the threshold value but if the next day a sudden drop in temperature happened then S_t could now be very far from the threshold. The exponential smoothing prevents such sudden changes in S_t by smoothing out the temperature data."
